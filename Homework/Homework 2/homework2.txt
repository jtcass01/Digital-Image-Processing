Do the following:
(a) Purpose a method for extracting the bit planes of an image based on
converting the value of its pixels to binary.
(b) Find all the bit planes o the following 4-bit image:
        0  1  8  6
        2  2  1  1
        1  15 14 12
        3  6  9  10

Obtain the unnormalized and the normalized histograms of the following 8-bit,
MxN image.  Give your histogram either in a table or a graph, labeling clearly
the value and location of each histogram component in terms of M and N.
Double-check your answer by making sure that the histogram components add to the
correct value.

An image with intensities in the range [0, 1] has the pdf, p(r), shown in the
following figure.  It is desired to transform the intensity levels of this image
so that they will have the specified p(z) shown in the figure.  Assume continuous
quantities, and find the transform that will accomplish this.

The image in Fig 3.30(c) is of size 1000 x 683 pixels.  Its histogram, labeled
"b" in Fig. 3.30(b), was intended to be uniform, but the result is not quite
uniform (observe the shape change at the low end of the intensity scale).
How do you explain this?
